# CHALLENGES and FEATURES

- I used Faker Gem to populate my data. I encounteredd a weird behavior in terms of column alignment when displayed because some of the data that were added were I bit longer than expected so it occupied a big space which affected the other columns. I tried different aprroach and use tab but no luck. 
- I would love to add more features but I don't have the luxury of time to do it.
